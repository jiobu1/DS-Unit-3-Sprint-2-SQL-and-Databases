Load the data (use pandas) from the provided file buddymove_holidayiq.csv (the BuddyMove Data Set) - you should have 249 rows, 7 columns, and no missing values. The data reflects the number of place reviews by given users across a variety of categories (sports, parks, malls, etc.).

Using the standard sqlite3 module:

    Open a connection to a new (blank) database file buddymove_holidayiq.sqlite3
    Use df.to_sql (documentation) to insert the data into a new table review in the SQLite3 database

Then write the following queries (also with sqlite3) to test:

    Count how many rows you have - it should be 249!
    How many users who reviewed at least 100 Nature in the category also reviewed at least 100 in the Shopping category?
    (Stretch) What are the average number of reviews for each category?

Your code (to reproduce all above steps) should be saved in buddymove_holidayiq.py, and added to the repository along with the generated SQLite database.
