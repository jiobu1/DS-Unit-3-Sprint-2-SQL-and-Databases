#rpg_mongo.py

"""
Reproduce (debugging as needed) the live lecture task of setting up and 
inserting the RPG data into a MongoDB instance, and add the code you write 
to do so here. Then answer the following question (can be a comment in 
the top of your code or in Markdown) 
- "How was working with MongoDB different from working with PostgreSQL? 
What was easier, and what was harder?

- Adding the db to mongo was easier for me than adding data to the postgres, 
but overall both are just different rather than harder or easier.
